Purpose: 
This repository was created to develop an application for the Clay County Kansas Historical Museum. The purpose of the app is two-fold.
1) Search by name for land records to display on a county map
2) Click on a county map and display relevant land records.


Supplemental information:
Overview of Public Land Survey System - https://geokansas.ku.edu/public-land-survey-system

What's Next? 
Is it possible to access existing GIS (Geographic Information System) data to build our application? How can we find out?
